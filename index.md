Common standalone C++11 utilities.

`Cool` is a collection of self-contained headers that provide convenient
utilities missing in the standard library.

Unlike [Boost](http://www.boost.org), `Cool`'s utilities are not meant to
be "usable across a broad spectrum of applications".  Instead, each
header brings a zero-configuration solution to common problems.  As a result,
`Cool` is not as configurable as Boost, however, it intends to be much easier
to use.
